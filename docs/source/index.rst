Code block example
------------------

This section will be deleted or hidden later on but just help you guide how to use code block in Sphinx so that we can effectively visualise code/shell commands or etc. 

* **Getting started**:
  :doc:`/code-block-examples`

Sub-menu examples
-----------------
This is a simple example how to create sub menus. When you create a sub menu, please follow the file name convention such that ``subMenuXX`` where ``XX`` indicates the sequence number of sub-menu. In addition, you can place a newly created sub menu file (e.g., ``subMenu03.rst``) under ``docs/source/subMenu``.

* **Sub-menu**:
  :doc:`/subMenu/subMenu01` |
  :doc:`/subMenu/subMenu02` 

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :hidden:
   :caption: Sub Menus

   /subMenu/subMenu01
   /subMenu/subMenu02
